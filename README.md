The enclosure comes as 6 laser cut acrylic pieces, 4 plastic standoffs, 8 hex-nuts and 8 1/2" 4-40 screws. Assembly is easy, and requires only a Phillips screwdriver. Once assembled, the box has lovely engraved ends with cut-outs for the DC power, Ethernet, microSD card, USB host and USB debug ports. The ends are even bone shaped - they act as a bumper to keep the attachment screws from scratching your desk.
